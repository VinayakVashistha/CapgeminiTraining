1. How is stack used in function calls (Call Stack)?
A stack stores function call details in stack frames and follows LIFO so the last called function returns first.

2. How is stack used in Undo/Redo operations?
Undo/Redo uses two stacks where the most recent action is pushed and popped to reverse or restore actions using LIFO.

3. Why is stack useful in expression evaluation?
Stack helps evaluate expressions by temporarily storing operands and applying operators in correct order.

4. Differentiate between Infix, Prefix, and Postfix expressions.
Infix places the operator between operands, Prefix before operands, and Postfix after operands
